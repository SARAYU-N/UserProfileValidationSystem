## **User Profile Validation System (Python)**

**Project Description** 

The User Profile Validation System is a Python-based application that validates user input such as username, password, email ID, phone number, and age.
The system ensures that all user details follow predefined rules before accepting and storing the profile information.
it makes our work easy in creating a more valid profile!
This code helps us to find if the input is valid or not.
This project is useful for understanding input validation, string handling, and basic Python programming concepts.

 **Objectives**

- Validate user input correctly.
- Practice Python string methods and conditional logic.
- Simulate real-world form validation logic
